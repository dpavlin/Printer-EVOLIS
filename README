Pixel-exact driver for EVOLIS Dualys two-side card printer in perl


This is experimental support for EVOLIS Dualys 3 printer with black ribbon (K) to provide
pixel-exact driver with support for two-side printing.

Existing cups driver available at

http://www.evolis.com/eng/Drivers-Support/Product-support/Dualys-3

does work, but I haven't been able to make it print duplex on cards, especially when generating
front and back pages separatly.
