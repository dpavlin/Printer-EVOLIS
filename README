NAME
    Printer::EVOLIS - pixel-exact driver for EVOLIS Dualys two-side card
    printer in perl

DESCRIPTION
    This is experimental support for EVOLIS Dualys 3 printer with black
    ribbon (K) to provide pixel-exact driver with support for two-side
    printing.

    Existing cups driver available at

    http://www.evolis.com/eng/Drivers-Support/Product-support/Dualys-3

    does work, but I haven't been able to make it print duplex on cards,
    especially when generating front and back pages separatly.
